# Book Rental System
This homework's aim is develop a book rental system.

The rental system must be capable of:

- Learn username of user

- Ask user for book title(NameOfBook), book type(TypeOfBook), and
      number of days user wants to rent(RentTimeOfBook)

- Display username, the total rent cost, and the total late fees

In order to achieve all the aims I used dictionaries(RentalFeeDict, LateFeeDict) and lists(BookNameList, BookTypeList, BookRentTime)
